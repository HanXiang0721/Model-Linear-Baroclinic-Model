* Note for the LBM package development
*
?   1998   [Hiro Watanabe]   Start developping linearization
			     to the CCSR/NIES AGCM dyn. core
Feb 1999   [Hiro Watanabe]   First steady computation
Sep 1999   [Hiro Watanabe]   Storm track model
Oct 1999   [Hiro Watanabe]   LBM ver. 1.0 completed

* In ver. 1.0:

	* steady response
	* time integration
	* eigenanalysis
	* singular mode analysis
	* storm track model

Aug 2000   [Hiro Watanabe]   PWM for AO simulation
Jun 2001   [Hiro Watanabe]   Start LBM ver. 2.0
Aug 2001   [Hiro Watanabe]   LBM ver. 2.0 time integration done

* In ver. 2.0:

	* moisture equation inorporated
	* convective adjustment parameterized
	     -> forcing modified to SSTA but not diabatic heating
	        (conventional method still available)
	* model restructure
	* full matrix / block matrices solver unidifed
	* barotropic model
	* LAPACK routines included
	* Lmake.inc configurate everything
	* direct access discarded
	* nonlinear time integration

Dec 2001   [Hiro Watanabe]   LBM ver. 2.0 completed

* In ver. 2.1-2.2:
	
	* bug fix
	* semi-implicit orographic forcing 
	* mLBM-CZ (optional)
	* linear LSC scheme
	* accelerated steady solver AIM

Aug 2005   [Hiro Watanabe]   LBM ver. 2.2 completed

* ver. 3.0 afterwards will include:

	* unified data format into GrADS
	* unified include files in model/ and solver/
	* rewriting with f90
	* new storm track model
	* parallelize
	* Lanchos algorithm, adjoint
	* incorporatin radiation, land surface and ocean models
